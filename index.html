My parents are divorced so I grew up switching between households but primarily lived with my mom. I have one dog at my mom’s house. His name is Olaf (like the snowman), he is 2 years old, and he is an English Bulldog. We tend to call him Loaf because he likes to just lay around the house.</p>

In Highschool I took Music class all the way through and I know how to play the Flute, Alto Saxophone, Tenor Saxophone, and Piccolo.

		<p>Hi, my name is Marisa Settimi and I’m a first year Interactive Media Development – 3D Visualization student. I am 19 years old and I’m from Hamilton, Ontario. I grew up with 2 siblings, my sister Marina and my half brother Ryan and my parents. I love being creative and using my artistic ability to draw, paint, create posters and logos. My passion is also to volunteer and help people. 
</p>

<p>
        I was apart of many volunteer clubs in High School. It was the same few of us that would run each committee because that’s what we loved to do. I was the tech head in each committee, I’d design our t-shirts, posters, logos, flyers and videos. That’s where my passion started, it never felt like work to me. I always had a great time being creative and thinking of ideas. 
</p>
<p>
        I grew up wanting to be a Disney artist but as I got to High School I realized that there weren’t many art classes and the mandatory classes were all science, english and math based. In grade 11 when we had to choose our career path I blindly chose Nursing not realizing what that entails as a career. After a year of science and math classes, I was sitting in a Grade 12 bio class when I realized it wasn’t for me and I couldn’t see myself doing this in post-secondary as well as the rest of my life. I went home and started looking at design programs all over Ontario. I never thought that I could go into a career and be able to make money with something I really enjoyed doing.
